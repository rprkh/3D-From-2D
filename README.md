# 3D Reconstruction From A Single 2D Image

This project demonstrates an end to end pipeline for reconstructing a 3D point cloud and mesh from a single RGB image using a pretrained depth estimation model and Open3D. The pipeline performs monocular depth estimation, converts depth maps into RGBD representations, generates point clouds, applies post processing, and finally reconstructs a 3D mesh.
